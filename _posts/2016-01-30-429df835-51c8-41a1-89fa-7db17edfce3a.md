Live at **Flappers**... This Sunday

This Sunday at 7 I'll be performing at Flappers in Burbank. As always it will be a one of a kind show. I have found the room there to be great for writing and exploring new material and new concepts. Saturday night I'll be at the Improv on Melrose doing Setlist ..an Improv stand up experience that is one of a kind... but it's a smaller set... 7 to 10 minutes... Sunday is an hour without outside cues and direction. I love it. Join me
